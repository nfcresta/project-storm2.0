# project-storm2.0

Welcome to our repository holding our Final Project files for Project Storm 2.0.

Team members include: Nick Cresta, Eric Dowd, Marcus Guerrier, Geoff Matis, and Ana Morales.

Building upon our second project, we are using storm data for 2018, 2019, and 2020 to build a predictive model using linear regression and random forest classifier as it relates to property damage related to weather events. 2018 and 2019 data will be used as our test data to build/train the model; we will then use the model to predict Jan-June 2020 data (as that is the only 2020 data we have available) and compare against the actual 2020 data to see how accurate our predictions were.

Data Source: We are sourcing our data from Kaggle, but ultimately from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). We will be working with 3 different CSVs and merging together to create one clean, large dataframe to work with.
